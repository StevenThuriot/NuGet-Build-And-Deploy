NuGet Build And Deploy
======================

* Little script to automatically create NuSpec files using reflection and build your solution into a NuGet pack.
* Post-build event.

I realise it’s a quick and dirty solution, but for a tool this small and simple it really doesn’t matter, nor is it worth spending a lot more time on it. It took a minimal amount of work to make, it does what it is supposed to do and that is more than enough for its purpose.
